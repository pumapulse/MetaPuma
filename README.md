## 🧪 Local Development

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
cd frontend && npm install
cd ../backend && npm install
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Create `.env` files in both `frontend/` and `backend/` as needed.  
Example for frontend:
```
VITE_FACTORY_ADDRESS=0x524Fec22546B087E91D198745CdD6ea94C057D79
VITE_CHAIN_ID=97
```

### 3. Run Locally

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run run build
serve dist
```

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

**Contracts (optional):**
```bash
cd contracts
npx hardhat deploy --network bnbTestnet
```

## 🔐 Security & Best Practices

- **MetaMask SDK:** Secure wallet connection and transaction signing
- **Upgradeable Contracts:** OpenZeppelin proxy pattern for upgradability
- **Draco Compression:** Fast, efficient 3D model loading
- **Error Handling:** User-friendly toasts and error messages throughout

---

## 🧠 Notable Design Choices

- **On-chain social graph:** Follows, posts, and copy trades are all tied to wallet addresses
- **Reputation engine:** Aggregates on-chain and social activity for scoring
- **Responsive UI:** Fully mobile-friendly, with custom loader and animated transitions
